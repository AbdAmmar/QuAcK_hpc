# QuAcK

QuAcK is a small quantum chemistry package which does some weird stuff.

In particular, quack can perform

i) various types of GW calculations (G0W0, evGW, qsGW, etc).

ii) ensemble DFT calculations (under progress)

QuAcK also includes a very slow integral package called IntPak which does compute many types of different integrals.
